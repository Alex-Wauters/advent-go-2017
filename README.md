# Advent of Code 2017 in Go

This repository contains code submissions in Go (golang) for the Advent of Code 2017 programming challenges. For my 2016 solutions in Go, see https://github.com/Alex-Wauters/advent-go-2016

Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.

## Installing Go

As IDE I use the Go plug-in for IntelliJ Idea (=GoLand)

Your favorite editor may have a go plug-in:
